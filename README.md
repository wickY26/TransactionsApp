# Transactions APP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
It also uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for components demo and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) for implementing material components
and lastly [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling.

## Quick Start

You should install packages at first by running

### `npm install`

after that install server packages by running

### `npm run install:server`

with the packages ready you can start application (both client and server) by running

### `npm run start`

This project currently 100% coverage but still it is good to check that :D

### `npm test -- --coverage`

You can also browse components via Storybook by running 

### `npm run storybook`

That is for now...

## Things to add

* E2E tests will be added with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
* Right now there is no error handler
* Styled components only used for demo purpose there should be more styles
* Account balance details component for showing user transactions history

Please feel free to give idea about what to add/change to project. Thank you.
